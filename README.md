# Machine Learning for Astronomy
Coursework and projects for a graduate-level elective course on Machine Learning for Astronomy.

### Final Project
For the final project I attempted to compare the use of different clustering algorithms to classify small exoplanets into two groups. I concluded that the algorithms overcomplicated the problem, which can be solved with a simple Support Vector Machine (SVM). The code and corresponding data can be found in this repository.
